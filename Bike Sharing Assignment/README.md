## Analysis Approach
- Business understanding : To evaluate the demand for the upcoming year based on the data provided.
- Data Understanding:  Understanding the data by exploring it and understanding its characterisitics.
- Data Cleaning and manipulation : Clean the data. Set the data to correct datatypes. 
- Data Quality : Checking the quality of data by checking the outliers in the continuous variables. 
    Mapping the categorical variables with numerical data to string data for better readability
- Exploratory data analysis:  To understand if there is any patterns and creating derived variables to understand the data better.
